## Previewing the page locally

1. In this directory, start a local static file server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Visit [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser to see the page.
3. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal to stop the server when you're done.

Alternatively, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser without running a server, though some browsers may restrict certain features when opening files from disk.
